# Portfolio
The Portfolio of William Flores

In this repository is where I was able to use everything I have learned about html and css. I started off with no code at all and was suppose to develope my own porfolio page to show employers. This was a lot harder than I expected, I found myself constantly looking up information to create my code. I didn't have any web applications to show off in this file, but I just added a few random ones until can provide my own. This portfolio tells about who I am, what work I have done, and a way to contact me.

## HTML
Found myself having not so much trouble with html. I learned that placement in the html does matter, as I had to go back a few times to fix or adjust certain order of the file in order for it to appear in a certain spot. I tried to make sure I didn't use "div" tag unless I needed to, tried to contiune using semantic HTML elements. For the most part, html section wasn't to diffcult.
  
## CSS
The CSS part of this project was actually very difcult for me. I constantly was making mistakes and having to test things out in order to know what certain tags did. I honestly would say it helped even though it took long because I got to now use some trial and error and learn from my mistakes. I continue to look many things up on Google, but Google is also a coder's best friend. There were many times I was stuck but as long as you keep calm and look over your code your bound to find your mistake. I honestly feel that I improved writing this portfolio and I am glad I got to create it. Will continue working on it as long as I can.
